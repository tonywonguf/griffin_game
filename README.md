A simple web game based on famous English mathemetician John Conway's "The Angel Problem".

## Background

> The Angel and the Devil play their game on an infinite chessboard, with one square for each ordered pair of integers *(x, y)*. On his turn, the Devil may eat any square of the board whatsoever; this square is then no longer available to the Angel. The Angel is a “chess piece” that can move to any uneaten square *(X, Y)* that is at most 1000 king’s moves away from its present position *(x, y)*—in other words, for which *|X − x|* and *|Y − y|* are at most 1000. Angels have wings, so that it does not matter if any intervening squares have already been eaten.
> 
> The Devil wins if he can strand the Angel, that is, surround him by a moat of eaten squares of width at least 1000. The Angel wins just if he can continue to move forever.
> 
> What we have described is more precisely called an *Angel of power* 1000. The Angel Problem is this:
> 
> *Determine whether an Angel of some power can defeat the Devil.*

This is John Conway's description of *The Angel Problem* in Volume 29 of the MSRI's *Games of No Chance*.  Conway originally proposed this problem in 1982, and offers cash rewards for those who could either prove that an angel of *n* power has a winning strategy,  or that the devil can win irregardless of the angel's power.

We found the premise of Conway's problem extremely interesting, and realized that it would make for a very fun video game.
